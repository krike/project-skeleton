## Project skeleton

A simple PHP/Backbone project skeleton for small projects. Projects that only require a minimum of code. Feel free to use it, fork and update.

Don't forget to update your project namespace in the files contained in the src folder, composer.json and Javascript files (you can completely drop the later one if you do not wish to use this js structure).

## Get started

To get started run:

    phing install

For deployment to production server use:

    phing deploy
