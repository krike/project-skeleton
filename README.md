project-skeleton
================

this github repo contains a simple PHP/Backbone project skeleton for small projects. Projects that only require a minimum of code. Feel free to use it, fork and update.

don't forget to update your project namespace in the files contained in the src folder, composer.json and Javascript files (you can completely drop the later one if you do not wish to use this js structure).

To get started run:

    phing install

For generating the css & javascript on the fly run the following:

    grunt default watch
